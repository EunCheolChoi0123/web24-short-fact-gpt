TWEET is a statement made on Twitter, which is a social media platform. The statement in the TWEET, ""@UNICEF thanks for the valuable news about corona virus....."", is a statement of gratitude towards UNICEF for providing information about the COVID-19 pandemic.
CLAIM, on the other hand, refers to a statement or assertion made by UNICEF in their advisory regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. The statement ""UNICEF issued Coronavirus advisory stating eight claims"" implies that UNICEF made eight specific claims or statements about the pandemic.
